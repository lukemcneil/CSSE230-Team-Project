A concise description and justification of your proposed data structures.

Our plan is to create a map of the academic buildings of RHIT. We will use a graph to store the nodes and edges which connect
each classroom. The graph will have a HashMap of nodes, where the key identify the node, and the node will have an ArrayList of
edges. This allows us to find any node, and all nodes have their edges. Each edge will hold two nodes (the ones it connects) and
the distance and stair count of the path.
